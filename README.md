# Transcriptomics analysis of leukaemia cells

In the following study, data from leukaemia publications (Weniger et al. (2018), Brune et al. (2008), Giefing et al. (2013)) will be used to measure and compare the expression patterns of CB cells, healthy precursors of mature B lymphocytes, with two types of tumour lymphocytes: NLPHL cells, extracted from patients with nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodkin's lymphoma; and cLH cells from classical Hodkin's lymphoma.


The healthy cells show a different expression pattern to the tumour cells, recognisable using the GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus microarrays. 2.0 microarrays from affymetrix, making it a valid diagnostic method. It is functional, but invasive because it requires a biopsy of the tonsils.
The cHL and NLPHL tumour cells also show a different expression pattern, suggesting a different origin of the cancer. different origin of the cancer. Both mainly affect the same biological processes (energy metabolism, immune function and cell cycle). metabolism, immune function and cell cycle) but in different ways. At the level of energy metabolism appear similar, this could be studied to find therapeutic targets.

The code is written in R with bioconductor packages, the comments are written in Spanish.
